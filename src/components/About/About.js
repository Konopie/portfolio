        I am a 20 year old graduate of the coding bootcamp at UNCC. 
        Coding novice trained in the MERN stack, looking for a job to advance my learning. I recently moved to South Carolina, and I'm hoping to start a career in tech.
        Although I may lack experience, I am confident I would be valuable to any team or business, this is supported by the fact that
        I scored better than 93% of applicants on the ASVAB (an aptitude test for the armed forces).
